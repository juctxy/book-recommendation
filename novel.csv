Harry Potter: Dimensional Wizard,LazySageDao,"Edward was reincarnated into the world of Harry Potter, an act which excites him giving the fact that this was one of his favorite books. So, he embarks on the path of wizardry in the hope of discovering the way it works, the laws or theories that govern it; he wanted to find its essence.When Edward finally uncovers the answers to the question he pondered on, he suddenly thought to himself: «Since the world of Harry Potter is real, what about all the other anime, movies, games, and books that I read from my past life? And if they are indeed real, how I can I get there?»***This story is an Infinite Stream novel where the mc travels through different anime and movie worlds acquiring various magical abilities and knowledge in order to become a supreme wizard that stands on the top of countless dimensions and universes.Warnings: The MC will spend a great deal of time in the Harry Potter World before going to other worlds.I have not decided whether the [Curse Child] is canon or not. I do not care what JK Rowling said.Although this fanfic will be a Harem, the mc will not have a thousand women. Most likely, I will write so that he has a certain relationship with some female characters, then he will leave her in her own universe. Only a few will follow him in his journey. Also, a few men will also be in his group. THIS IS NOT A YAOI.If you enjoy my writing, please go read my other novel. [Journey of the Fate Destroying Emperor] Although the story is slow in the beginning, it is worth the wait for the later plots.","Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Harem","Fanfiction, Bloodlines, Dark, Eidetic Memory, Elemental Magic, Human Experimentation, Magical Technology, Protagonist Strong from the Start, ",4.1,533,645

They don’t know which cards they’ll be handing down, but that’s not the real issue. The bigger problem is that of the 100 random cards, we can’t even choose which of the 5 we get to use. We have to pick them with our eyes closed.Now imagine each of these cards represents a different trait – maybe an attractive face, an intelligent mind, a great body, a handicap.

Who would have guessed that behind that beaming smile of hers was a numb heart that aimed only to make more profit?""You got it wrong."" Lily elegantly propped her chin on the back of her hand. ""I am seeing you today because we have something in common. We're both villains in somebody else's eyes. And I think it's time for us villains to get our own happy ending. Don't you think so?""---Zhuo Jingren’s love for Lily Qin was something that only he knew. Ever since they were children, he had his eyes on her. Yet, every time he had tried to confess, he would end up fainting from nervousness.So when Lily Qin promised to marry him if he became richer than her, Zhou Jingren did not hesitate to leave the orphanage and work his way up just to become her man.Who would have thought that years later, when he was successful and feared by many, he would come back to an engaged Lily Qin?Then she mistook him for an escort after eating his tofu? Preposterous!The worst thing was, she seemed to have forgotten everything about him. Hadn’t she promised to marry him the moment he became more prominent than her family? Now, after taking advantage of him, she dared to run away?This woman was a liar!He gritted his teeth as he watched her approach him. He was about to say something mean when she suddenly spoke. “Are you my new bodyguard?” She did not even wait for him to answer before tossing her car keys at him. “Drive. Let’s go wreak some havoc.”Thus, the mafia’s big boss became Lily Qin’s bodyguard.---""So? What do you want as a compensation?"" Zhuo Jingren asked her once again before laying down next to her. His elbow was resting on the ground and his palm was supporting his head as he looked at her intently.The first thing that Lily noticed about Zhuo Jingren when he laid next to her was his exposed tanned chest. This made him look more casual… and hot. She didn't even realize she was staring at the latter.""Why are you staring at me like that?"" He smirked at her. ""Do you want me to compensate you with my body?""Lily immediately rolled her eyes at the latter. ""Who wants your body? Hmp! I want money!""""Your mind is always thinking of money but your body actually betrays you. Am I right to say that I have a shameless wife?""""Hah! I am a strong and independent woman of the 21st century. I know what I want. But if you insist on giving your body, I will take it too!"" Lily shamelessly said, taking off her stilettos. However, just when Lily was about to lie down beside Zhuo Jingren, he suddenly pulled her on top of him. With her body on top of his, their faces were really close and they could even feel each other's breath.""What a shameless woman,"" he noted, the smile on his face only deepened.....There is no RAPE or MAJOR MISUNDERSTANDINGS.WARNING: FL is scheming and evil.Priv Cost: 5 ss for 5 advance chaptersDiscord: https://discord.gg/Jw2YjfrInstagram: @blips01Editor: Swaning, Ocelot","Contemporary Romance, Romance, Comedy","Female Protagonist, Romance, Clever Protagonist, Comedy, Power Couple, Handsome Male Lead, Doting male lead, Business Management, no-misunderstanding, Modern Day, Beautiful Female Lead, ",4.1,687,912
